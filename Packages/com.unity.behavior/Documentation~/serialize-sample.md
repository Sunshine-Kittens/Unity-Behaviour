# Runtime Serialization sample

The **Runtime Serialization** sample demonstrates how to implement runtime serialization of behavior agents and their states in Unity. It includes a simple scenario where the agents move and act autonomously, and you can save and load their states across play sessions.

| Topic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [Set up and run the sample](xref:serialize-run) | Import, run, and explore the sample to check agents in action. | 
| [How behavior graph works](xref:serialize-work) | Learn how the **Agent** behavior graph drives movement through blackboard variables, looping sequences, and a custom node for randomized navigation. | 
| [Scripts and serialization architecture](xref:serialize-scripts) | Explore how the sample manages agent serialization, deserialization, and object reference resolution through core scripts and data classes. |
