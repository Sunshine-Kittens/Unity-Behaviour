  "description": "Unity Behavior is a graph-based tool to create and run behavior trees with a modular architecture.\n\n▪ Human-readable graphs flow top-to-bottom with plain-language nodes\n▪ Comprehensive library of pre-built nodes for movement, detection, and decision-making\n▪ Seamless C# integration with a familiar lifecycle model\n▪ Hierarchical design supporting reusable subgraphs\n▪ Real-time debugging visualization during Play mode\n▪ Event-driven architecture for dynamic game reactions\n\nIdeal for NPC behaviors, quest logic, environmental interactions, and game state management.\n\nA demo showcasing this package can be found in the Asset Store <a href=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/behavior-demo-for-unity-298313>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/behavior-demo-for-unity-298313</a>.",
