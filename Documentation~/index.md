# About Unity Behavior

Unity Behavior is a visual tool for authoring behaviors that control non-player characters (NPCs), gameplay logic, objects, and scene interactions in Unity.

Use Unity Behavior to control the interactions of multiple characters, orchestrate cinematic scenes, trigger timed or contextual events, and react to player actions. It takes the complexity out of behavior authoring, thereby bringing vision to life with ease.

> [!NOTE]
> Unity refers to behavior trees as **behavior graphs** to highlight its advanced capabilities and added features. Unlike traditional behavior trees, behavior graphs in Unity Behavior allow for non-linear structures where branches can merge back, enabling more complex and interconnected behaviors.

> [!NOTE]
> It's free to use Unity Behavior.

Explore the Unity Behavior features and get started with using behavior graphs.
